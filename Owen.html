<h2>About me:</h2>

<h4>Where I came from:</h4>
<p>Born in Hayes, London in 1997. Then in 2002 I ended up moving to Leicester with my family. It was an absolute mission, but very exciting (I hadn't even heard of
  Leicester before then). 18 years later, I'm still here! It's not so bad for the most part, far better than Hayes, but I would love to find myself moving to a new
  city once I finish my degree in 3 years.</p>

<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
<p>It seems that the most prominant subject I speak about is Film Photography. You'll be glad to know that today is no exception!</p>
<p>It was actually my brother that got me into film photography, I was quite stubborn at first. Quite comfortable with my digital Canon,
  I wasn't prepared for the world of analogue. However, eventually I gave in and bought myself an original Olympus OM1n, in black (a rare colourway
  in  good condition). Anyway, I dived straight in and now I develop and scan all of my own images! It's a hugely rewarding process and I'm so glad I started!</p>
<p>If you're interested, I've added a link to the Leica website at the bottom of the page, probably my favourite camera brand to date.</P>
