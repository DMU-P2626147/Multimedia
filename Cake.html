     the viewport meta tag. 

    In Atom, when you create a new HTML file, type html and hit tab and it'll fill lots of this out for you. I show that at the
    end of the Starter Code video in week 1. -->

  <!-- This is a good start. 
       You've tried to use the style attribute to make the heading bold, but got it a little wrong.
       To make something bold, you need style="font-weight:bold". In this case though, headings are
       made bold by default, so you don't need that here. -->

  <!-- You've put a . at the end of img here, telling the browser that the folder is called "img.", with a dot. 
       It's probably just called "img" so get rid of the dot. You should also upload that folder to github so 
       that it can find the images. You can drag the whole folder onto the drop area on the upload page. -->

    <!-- You open up a <div> and a <footer> element but you've not closed either of them.
         The closing tags for both need to go in here.
         Incidentally, if you're using the <footer> element here, there's no need to also wrap it in a <div>
    -->

    <!-- After all your content, you need to close the <body> element, and the <html> element that was opened
         right at the top of the page -->
